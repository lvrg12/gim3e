    """ Gene Inactivity Moderated by Metabolism, Metabolomics, and Expression (GIM^3E)
    Create model from mRNA expression data (and/or potentially high coverage proteomics)
    while requiring the utilization of specific network metabolites
    
    Arguments:
     cobra_model: the model object.  note the objective should be specified in the model already
     
     expression_dict: expression data of form GENE: value
                      values are treated with linear penalty terms
                      below the threshold.  e.g. could be log2 intensities
                      or log p-values.

                      If we have p/a associated p-values,
                      can use +log p (two-tail) for the appropriate
                      directionality vs. background if absent, 0 if present,
                      with an associate threshold of log(alpha/2).  P-values
                      should be multiple testing corrected before calling
                      gim3e.

                      We can also use P/A calls, with P = 1 and A = 0
                      if we define the expression_threshold as 1
                      (not tested yet, should work)

                      If reaction ID's are given as keys, or the
                      threshold is specified as None, then these
                      (positive) penalties are applied directly to
                      the prblem (and the threshold is ignored).
                      
    expression_threshold: threshold value.  Values below threshold will be
     processed as sources of penalty.
     
    fraction_growth: fraction of the optimal objective value that must be met
     when applying constraints.  The objective should be set in the model before
     calling gim3e

    relative_penalty_bound: required fraction of the best penalty score, must
     be greater than 1.  E.g. maximum allowed penalty will be 1.05 X
     the best achievable for a given growth constraint if this is set
     to 1.05.  This is added as a model constraint.  A value of zero
     implies no limit.

    metabolite_list: list of metabolit id's to add 'turnover metabolite' constraints
     to.  To get FVA results for internal metabolites without bounds, you
     can set this to True and tm_flux_requirement to False
                 
    solver_tolerance: rough cutoff for metabolomics and solver tolerance,
      metabolites will have 1.01X tolerance 
      and optimization will have 1X tolerance.

    metabolite_flux_requirement: if True, metabolites from metabolite_list
      will be required to carry flux

    monitor_all_cellular_metabolites: if True, turnover metabolites will be added
      without flux requirements to monitor the remaining cellular metabolites

    MILP_formulation: If True, the model will be converted to a MILP.  Indicator
     variables and metabolites will be added to enforce reaction directionality.
     This eliminates flux loops for turnover metabolites but is computationally
     costly to solve.

    run_FVA: boolean, whether to run FVA for the model.  Note this must
     be set to true for reduce_model to run.
              
    reduce_model: boolean, if false we simply implement penalty as
     a constraint.  if true we further disable reactions not used
     for which data suggests are penalized and do not carry a flux.

    trim_model: boolean, whether to remove (delete) reactions that don't carry 
                 flux.                  

   Returns a tuple containing:
    new_cobra_model: the processed model.  Penalty is
      converted to a constraint, also note that the model is converted to
      irreversible to enable the constraint and monitoring of turnover
      metabolite fluxes
      
    FVA_result: the results from FVA with the new model.
     
    best_total_penalty: the best obtainable penalty measure for the specified
      constraints.

    This function provides a method for testing for gene, reaction, or turnover metabolite
     requirements for an irreversible model 
    
    Model should have objective identified and constraints set before calling
     this function!

    Arguments:
     cobra_model: Preferably, an objective reaction should be identified.  If not, we will
      just pick one to get a solution for hot-starting.

    kwargs:
     the_reactions: a dict of {key: [reactions]}, where all reactions under a key are KO'd together.
                    default None will result in a test KO for model reactions

     next arguments are solver/toelrance parameters, described previously: solver, tolerance_optimality
                    tolerance_feasibility, tolerance_barrier, tolerance_integer.

     starting_model: a separate cobra_model is used for hot-starting if supplied.  This 
      can be useful if there are difficulties finding solutions for the model.  Note 
      the bounds for each reaction should lie within the bounds for the cobra_model.
      This might be useful to put starting guesses in a different area of the solution space.

    error_reporting = None,
    number_of_processes

    Returns:
     variability_dict: a dictionary with the reaction id's as top-level keys,
      FVA ranges, and solver status.
